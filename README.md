# Bet With ETH Project

You can create your own Bet Game for the make money!

With simple logic, everyone joins the game by paying 1 ether, when 30 people are involved, 25 ether goes to the lucky person, and 5 ether goes to the owner of the platform. You can change the Owner Wallet address, participation fee and participants limit on the `contracts/BetWithBlockchain.sol` file.
